# substitutioncipher

## Description

This program asks the user for a string and a keyphrase, and whether to
encrypt the string or decrypt it. The encryption method uses a keyword [substitution cipher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher), which, when encrypting, takes each letter of
the alphabet and replaces it with another letter in the alphabet depending on how the ciphertext is generated from the keyphrase.

When decoding, the same method is used in reverse, i.e. encrypted letters
are replaced with letters in the alphabet based on where they are in the ciphertext generated by the keyphrase.
